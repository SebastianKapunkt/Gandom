				This site is a project from Early Birds. We are computer science
				students, and wrote in our course JEE-Webtechnologien this site. <br />
				The idea was to make a site that collect all your games to manage
				them.

				<IMG alt="gamecloud" src="resources/pictures/gameCloud.png"
					width="80%" /> <br /> <br />
				<h:form>
					<h:commandLink styleClass="button" value="Game Collection"
						action="#{navigationController.showGameCollection()}" />
				</h:form>
			</center>
			<p>But thats not all! A lot of people , not "normal" ones, have a
				lot a games. Not like 5 or 10, they have hundreds. So what you do
				with that bunch of games? Right you want to play them! But what game
				first? And this is the point we help you! We choose randomly a game
				that you can play!</p>
			<center>
				<h:form>
					<h:commandLink styleClass="button" value="Random Game"
						action="#{navigationController.showRandomGame()}" />
				</h:form>
			</center>
			<p>We wish you a lot of fun!</p>
			<p>Greetings Early Birds</p>
